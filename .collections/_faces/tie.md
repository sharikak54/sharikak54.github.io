Looks like a close-up on someone wearing a fancy yellow suit with a very short (or cut-off) tie.  The collar of the suit is made up of the two edges of this face; the corner between them is the throat of the human wearing the suit.

...Alternatively, the negative space looks like a pair of wings.  Honestly the wings' shapes remind me more of a butterfly, but "Moth" is a lot easier to say.  

> **Shari says:**  The yellow parts of the shape are pretty self-explanatory.  But did you notice that the lines between the white <a href="gem">gem</a>'s pieces act as the Moth's antennae?
