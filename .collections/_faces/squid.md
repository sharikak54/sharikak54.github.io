The big corner is the body of the squid, with the flared-out edges as the squid's tentacles.  The flaring probably means it's getting ready to dash away!

Alternatively, if you turn the squid upside down, you can see a simple angel icon with triangles for wings and a rounded dress.  (Imagine the haloed head right between the "wings".)
