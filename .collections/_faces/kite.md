Like the cubeshape case of the same name, this face is easily recognizable.  It's just half yellow and half white.

For consistency, we orient the kite with the heavy end upward; and the "Left" Kite is the one with yellow on the left.

Another way to remember Left vs Right is to look at any one of the four "pairs", and categorize it as if it were a [Tent](tent).  E.g. in the below picture, the bottom corner/edge pair of the white kite forms a tent with its flaps facing to the Left.
