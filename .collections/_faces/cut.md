So named because it looks like a <a href="kite">Kite</a>, which someone tore (or **cut**) a piece of it and then placed it on the other side.  The direction of this face matches that of <a href="kite">Kite</a> and <a href="tent">Tent</a>.

Alternatively: if you tilt it a bit, this face also looks like Zero, the ghost dog from Nightmare Before Christmas!  His long thin face is the odd edge out, and his two flappy ears cover the lone corner.  His body takes up the edge/corner pair, with the edge of the pair acting as Zero's front leg.
