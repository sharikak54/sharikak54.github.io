It's a little tent!  To determine which way a Tent faces, rotate it until its bottom is on the ground.  Its flaps will point to either the Left or Right.

You can easily identify the handed-ness of a [Kite](kite) or [Pinwheel](pinwheel) by breaking it into Tents; they should all match.  So if the Tent's flaps are facing left, you have a Left Kite or Pinwheel; and if they're facing right, you have a Right Kite or Pinwheel.
