A thumbs up to you, for doing such a good job learning your OBLs!  The curled fingers of the hand point to the direction of the face.  Think of holding out a thumbs up sign straight toward someone who did a good job (like you!).

For the alternative name, just flip the thumb upside down to see it.  It looks like a mounted satellite dish, scanning for television signals, radio, or aliens.  "Dish" is way easier to say, so we decided to drop the "Satellite" when referring to this face by that alias.
