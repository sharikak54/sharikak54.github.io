This face looks kind of like a [radioactive warning symbol](https://www.orau.org/health-physics-museum/articles/radiation-warning-symbol.html), albeit somewhat squished.  That symbol is one of several, called hazard symbols, hence the name for this face.

The badly drawn version below looks kind of like a fidget spinner, too.  Take your pick.  If you have a strong opinion feel free to contact us and make your case for one or the other.
