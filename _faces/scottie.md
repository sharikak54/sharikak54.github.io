A furry little dog howling at the moon.  It has so much fur that its feet barely stick out beyond its belly, making it seem like it's nearly aligned with the ground when walking.

The direction the dog is facing determines whether the face is "Left" or "Right".  We like to shorten this face to "Scottie".
