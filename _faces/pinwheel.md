Left/Right depends on which way it's spinning.  To remember which is which, look at the "long" end of the upper left leaf (or sail, triangle, flag, or whatever you want to call them; it's got four, two yellow and two white) of the Pinwheel.  That's the part that's lagging behind, so the Pinwheel is spinning towards the other direction.
