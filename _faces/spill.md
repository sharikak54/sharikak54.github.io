This face looks so 3D to me.  The "can" part of this face is made up of two pieces, an inside and an outside.  And then the spilled paint has to line up with the ground that the can is resting on.

If, on the other hand, it's easier for you to think of it as a 2D picture of a spill in progress, paint still in the air, go for it.
