## What is OBL?
OBL stands for "Orient Both Layers".  The most common method for solving the Square-1, the Vandenbergh Method, breaks down the puzzle into 5 steps:
1. Form cubeshape
2. Orient all corners
3. Orient all edges
4. Permute all corners
5. Permute all edges

OBL combines steps 2 and 3 above into one step.  We do it for 3x3, so why not for Square-1?

### Some history
Before about 2015, this idea had been considered but was immediately dismissed as "too many cases".  Shari didn't believe this, and started mathing out how many cases there actually are.  She produced a full OBL tree of 74 cases, with only two cases taking more than 5 moves optimal to solve, and hosted it on her personal Caltech website (which expired after her graduation) winter 2015.

<!-- TODO: NK clarify this section more -->
Not Kevin and Shari didn't advertise this method at all, so it dropped out of public knowledge until it started gaining popularity again around 2020.  (Paul Besci posted a couple videos in the interim, though!)  With many requests for more OBL resources, Not Kevin started a spreadsheet to disseminate his personal knowledge of the different OBL cases from a cuber's perspective.  Shari heard about this and thought that this would work better as a website, and here we are.

## Why OBL?
Okay, I hear you saying that 74 cases is still a lot.  That may be true, but hear me out:
* Most OBL cases (just over 70%) are optimal 4 moves or less -- the average movecount for an OBL movecount, weighted by probability of appearing, is actually _less_ than 4 -- and many of the 5-movers are pure CO or EO, so you already know them!
* OBL is roughly as hard as full cubeshape - cubeshape has 65 unique cases with a max length of 7 (compared to OBL's 74 cases with a max length of 6), and both have the same tree-like property that each cubeshape/OBL goes into another cubeshape/OBL.
* It's easy to build up your OBL skills without disrupting your times much - if you don't recognize a case immediately or you're not comfortable with the OBL yet, just do CO/EO :)

> **Not Kevin says:** The 6-move optimal algs are terrible so I actually use longer algs for those anyway.
