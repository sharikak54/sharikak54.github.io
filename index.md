## What is OBL?
OBL stands for "Orient Both Layers".  The most common method for solving the Square-1, the Vandenbergh Method, goes something like this:
1. Form cubeshape
2. Orient all corners
3. Orient all edges
4. Then do a bunch of permutation to finish

OBL combines steps 2 and 3 above into one step.  We do it for 3x3, so why not for Square-1?

### Some history
Before about 2015, this idea had been considered but was immediately dismissed as "too many cases".  Shari didn't believe this, and started mathing out how many cases there actually are.  She produced a full OBL tree of less than 80 cases, with only two cases taking more than 5 moves optimal to solve, and hosted it on her personal Caltech website (which expired after her graduation) winter 2015.

Not Kevin and Shari didn't advertise this method at all, so it dropped out of public knowledge until it started gaining popularity again around 2020.  (Paul Besci posted a couple videos in the interim, though!)  With many requests for more OBL resources, Not Kevin started a spreadsheet to disseminate his personal knowledge of the different OBL cases from a cuber's perspective.  Shari heard about this and thought that this would work better as a website, and here we are.

## Why OBL?
<!-- TODO hard numbers please! -->
Okay, I hear you saying that 80 cases is still a lot.  That may be true, but hear me out.  Most OBL cases are optimal 4 moves or less -- the average movecount for an OBL movecount, weighted by probability of appearing, is actually _less_ than 4 -- and many of the 5-movers are pure CO or EO, so you already know them!  The easiest way to get into OBL is by starting with the cases which are 3 moves or less, and using CO/EO for the cases you don't know yet, slowly building your way up.

> **Not Kevin says:** The 6-move optimal algs are terrible so I actually use longer algs for those anyway.
