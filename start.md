# Start Here

If you're here, you probably want to learn OBL!  This page will tell you how to use the site.

## For Beginners

<!-- TODO flesh out more? -->

Welcome!  There's only [1 1-move optimal case](/cases/lkite_lkite) (and 1 0-move optimal case, when OBL is already solved), which you pretty much already know.  So the best way to start is by learning the 2- and 3-move optimal cases.  There are only 5 2-move optimal cases, and 13 3-move optimal ones (and we'll leave the less common of those for the end of this section).

So let's start by looking at the [2-move optimal cases](/cases_by_optimal/2_move_optimal)!
