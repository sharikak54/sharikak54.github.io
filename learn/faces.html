<h1>OBL Faces</h1>

<p>
	Single square faces with mnemonics (images and/or descriptions) 
  for memorization.
  Each OBL case consists of two (not necessarily distinct) faces,
  one on the top and one on the bottom.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  By convention, the pictures here will have the yellow pieces comprise
  the portion of the image that the face is named after.
  TODO update all images
</p> -->

<!-- TODO convert ul to sortable/filterable table -->
<ul>
  {% for face in site.faces %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ face.url | replace: '.html','' }}">{{ face.name }}</a></h2>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
