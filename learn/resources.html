	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/506oBmtuYcU">Paul Becsi's Video Guide</a>:

<h2>General Square-1 Resources</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Beginner Tutorials
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/IkmlMEHYyzI">Samuel Fang's Beginner Tutorial</a>:
				A compact 30-minute video tutorial teaching a minimalistic Vandenbergh method.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180730053740/http://shellie.nfshost.com/cube/square1.php">Shellie's Sillie Square-1 Method</a>:
				Although other beginner methods might be faster, Shelley Chang's tutorial from 2009 is quite likely the simplest that exists.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Intermediate Vandenbergh Resources
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.cubezone.be/square1.html">Lars Vandenbergh's original tutorial</a>:
				Although the algorithms are outdated by today's standards, Lars' method is the CFOP of the Square-1 world.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/-fYJTvNSCdo">Samuel Fang's Intermediate Cubeshape Video</a>:
				Also known as "scallop-kite" cubeshape, this intermediate method adds one more "base case" (namely, scallop-kite) to dramatically shorten many intuitive solutions.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwlHUS7e-go">Samuel Fang's Advanced Cubeshape Video</a>:
				Sam walks through how to solve every cubeshape case in the optimal number of slices.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/o0z7lc/optimal_cubeshape_chart_for_square1/">Optimal Cubeshape Chart</a>:
				Based on Sam's video above, Reddit user r/olimo created this chart to show how the various cases connect to each other - like with OBL, optimal cubeshape forms a tree :)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://cubeorama.com/CS/">Gil Zussman's Cube-O-Rama: CS</a>:
				A very full-featured CS trainer, with integrations into Sam's video, along with case filtering, random scrambles, and timing.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/kUpSACA-VJU">Samuel Fang's CP Video</a>:
				Good algs for every CP case; many of these will be very useful for PBL later.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://youtu.be/JsuYDfhUkmE">Samuel Fang's Intuitive Non-Parity EP Video</a>:
				Instead of handling all 49 non-parity EPs as entirely disjoint algs, Sam walks through how to intuitively solve nearly all cases by just using a couple core algs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zZGyh8Mrp5qSguGDfFQoyksh0HVFtHY1tMW_zWW3R1Q/edit#gid=0">Daniel Karnaukh's Non-Parity EP Alg Sheet</a>:
				Still, some NPEP cases are significantly faster than an intuitive alg might be; Daniel's sheet contains a well-optimized alg for every case, often from multiple angles.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Advanced Vandenbergh Resources
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://hashtagcuber.com/csp/">Eva Kato's CSP guide</a>:
				A very well-presented website (with accompanying video) on learning CSP.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF0mfn_ogsH_ogg-ffsVVPvOMD6yRtBzf">Samuel Fang's PBL Guide</a>:
				One of the first full PBL resources created, Sam shows how to solve all non-parity PBL's efficiently (most commonly with 2 short algs), along with a slew of tips and tricks along the way.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bLhYXaW1HGGTypOQGOJvnS2L40gKXHlbc8zJ3ZXYeTE/edit?usp=sharing">Samuel Fang's PBL Sheet</a>:
				The spreadsheet form of Sam's guide above, for easier reference.
			</li>
