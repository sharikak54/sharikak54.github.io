<h1>The OBL Tree</h1>

<p>
  Below is a visual representation of all the OBL cases
  (ignoring left/right, top/bottom, and color symmetry).  
  The single case at the far left is the solved state,
  and each column to the right represents a slice taken.
  So the next column (also with only one case) requires
  one slice to get to the solved state.
</p>

<p>
  A line between two cases means that it's possible to get from
  one case to another.  (Only optimal connections are shown.)
  If you think of these as directed edges in a graph of all cases, 
  the diagram is what is known as a "tree" in graph theory 
  (with the root at the left and the leaves on the right); 
  hence the name.

<h2>Guidelines to Learning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    When learning OBL, you generally should start from the left 
    of the tree, and work your way right.  
    Not only are the leftwards cases easier to learn, 
    they'll also show up when learning rightwards cases
    that feed into them, reinforcing your learning.
  </li>
  <li>
    Also, note the little numbers to the
    right of each case.  Those represent the relative likelihood
    of that case showing up in a full solve using optimal-movecount OBL.
    <!-- TODO when we fix the weights update these words -->
    So in most cases you may want to start on a new column 
    before learning the very top and bottom cases.
  </li>
  <!-- TODO <li> for sorting via "difficulty" or "level" -->
</ul>
